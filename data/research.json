      "Our researches are focused on designing and engineering next-generation therapeutic platforms at the interface of immunology, synthetic biology, and artificial intelligence. We pioneer novel strategies to harness the power of living systems, such as engineering neutrophils directly within the body and reprogramming bacterial surfaces, transforming them into intelligent, targeted drug delivery vehicles. To translate these advanced cellular therapies into patient-friendly realities, we develop innovative microneedle patches for painless and efficient transdermal delivery. Crucially, we integrate artificial intelligence throughout our discovery pipeline, using machine learning to accelerate the rational design and optimization of these complex bio-hybrid systems. Our ultimate goal is to create a new paradigm of smart, precise, and accessible immunotherapies to tackle challenging diseases.",

    "intro": "In order to diagnose and treat many diseases such as cancer, inflammation and bacteria-induced infections, etc., drug delivery systems (DDSs) based on stimuli-responsive biomaterials with effective delivery strategy are attracted widely more and more attention and in-depth explored in recent years. DDSs epitomize multidisciplinary research including chemistry, material, biology, pharmacy and physics, which is central to innovation in modern bio-nano-technology. My research is focused on designing and generating multifunctional bioengineered stimuli-responsive biomaterials-based biomedical devices (nanomedicine) and strategies used to efficiently and effectively prevent and treat some diseases (e.g. cancer, sepsis, colorectal diseases) based on the understanding of molecular mechanism regulating the interactions between therapeutic nanoparticles and biological systems “in vivo”.",

    "detailedIntro": "I am now working at Shenzhen International Graduate School at Tsinghua University as an Assistant Professor/Principal Investigator. I have gathered unique expertise combining chemistry and chemical engineering (Ph.D. at South China University of Technology, China, Prof. Lijuan Zhang and Prof. Yu Qian), pharmacy and gene therapy (visiting Ph.D. student at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Germany, Prof. Ernst Wagner), pharmaceutical biology and biotechnology (Assistant Professor at National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, China), cell culture, animal model and immunology (Postdoctoral Associate/Research Associate at Washington State University, United States, Prof. Zhenjia Wang), bio-nano-technology and layer-by-layer technology (Postdoctoral Associate at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, Singapore/United States, Prof. Paula Hammond). I believe that there are many interesting ideas would be promoted based on my experience and passion (self motivation, organization and time management skills). I also have rich experience in writing proposal for external grants and publishing papers. I will try my best to establish the team and complete my research/teaching work. My goal is to develop efficient and effective nanomedicine, nano-food and strategy for the treatment of diseases.",

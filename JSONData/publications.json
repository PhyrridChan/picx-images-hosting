      "abstract": "Infections are the leading cause of neonatal mortality, yet disease management remains challenging due to nonspecific clinical manifestations. Although serial blood analyses remain critical for monitoring disease progression, the small and fragile nature of neonatal vasculature makes venipuncture challenging. Interstitial fluid (ISF) offers a promising alternative to blood for rapid and convenient diagnosis. Here we report a universal detection strategy based on swellable microneedle patches (SMNPs) that enable painless ISF collection and multiple biomarker analysis via compatible with existing infrastructure. Experimental validation in neonatal rat models achieves infection detection (<10 minutes) through C-reactive protein (CRP) quantitation and reveals strong ISF-serum correlations for CRP. Moreover, clinical validation involving 46 human volunteers demonstrates accurate ISF quantification of uric acid (UA) and total cholesterol (TC), with strong ISF-serum correlations observed for both biomarkers. These findings emphasize the universal compatibility of SMNPs-based strategy for multiple biomarker detection, offering a transformative solution for health management."

      "abstract": "Despite triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most heterogeneous and aggressive subtype of breast cancer, immunotherapy is emerging as a promising therapy. Here, a mannose-modified cationic liposome (cLipo)-based mRNA therapeutics with dendritic cell (DC) targeting and high safety is developed for TNBC immunotherapy. The cLipos are fabricated using mannose-modified PEGylated lipids, DOPE, DOTAP, and cholesterol, followed by systematic screening of formulations based on mRNA loading capacity, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficacy. The mTEM8, which is related to tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8, known as Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1), can be efficiently encapsulated into the optimal cLipo to prepare the mRNA therapeutics (cLipo-Man/mTEM8), which can deliver mTEM8 to DCs with an eightfold higher delivery efficiency compared with the commercial Liposomes. The cLipo-Man/mTEM8 therapeutics elicited robust immune activation, significantly enhancing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and improving antitumor efficacy in TNBC-bearing mice. The tumor growth of TNBC-bearing mice treated with the cLipo-Man/mTEM8 therapeutics is obviously suppressed, and the survival rate is doubled compared to other controls. Furthermore, the mannose-modified cLipo system demonstrated excellent biosafety in vivo. Collectively, this study presents a safe and effective mannose-modified cLipo-based mRNA therapeutic with strong potential for advancing TNBC immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris, a prevalent inflammatory skin disorder, poses significant clinical challenges due to its multifactorial pathogenesis involving Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) proliferation and chronic inflammation. Conventional therapies, including topical applications, oral medication, and laser treatments, face limitations in drug penetration, patient compliance, and therapy efficacy. Currently, the combined use of hydrophilic drugs and hydrophobic drugs is a commonly recommended clinical approach. However, conventional formulations severely struggle to effectively deliver and release both therapeutic agents at the affected site. To address these issues, we developed the dissolved bubble microneedle patches (DBMNPs) for the co-delivery of hydrophilic (dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, DPG), hydrophobic (PIONIN) drugs, and alongside salicylic acid (SA) at the same time. The DBMNPs, which were fabricated basing on hyaluronic acid (HA), featured hollow bubble structures to encapsulate lipophilic agents, enabling spatially segregated and temporally controlled drug release. The patches exhibited good mechanical strength, excellent biocompatibility, and potent antimicrobial activity against P. acnes. In vivo studies confirmed their efficacy in treating acne vulgaris, offering a minimally invasive and clinically translatable approach to enhance therapeutic effect while minimizing systemic side effects. This study reports a microneedle platform that successfully addresses the key challenge of co-loading and co-delivering both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and is expected to be applied in the treatment of other skin diseases."

      "abstract": "RNA therapy has emerged as a transformative approach for treating cancer. However, the clinical application of RNA therapy faces significant challenges due to the biological barriers such as enzymatic degradation, reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance, and low transfection efficiency. To address these limitations, a huge number of engineered nano/micro-scale vehicles have been thoroughly investigated and extensively used for targeted delivery of RNA. In this work, we summarized a comprehensive review of the nano/micro-scale targeted RNA delivery systems, coupled with critical insights into challenges and opportunities. We firstly reviewed the various nano/micro-scale vectors and technologies for RNA delivery in cancer therapy, including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, hydrogels, microneedles, exosomes, nanoparticles, metal–organic framework, covalent organic frameworks and living cells. We further summarized the challenges, highlighting the potential to achieve high therapeutic efficacy and minimal side effects. Ultimately, the perspectives of nano/micro-scale targeted RNA delivery systems are thoroughly discussed. Collectively, we believe that RNA therapies based on nano/micro-scale delivery strategies could be potentially applied in clinical fields to promote the improvement of cancer treatments."
